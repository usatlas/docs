# Jupyter At Shared Tier 3s
One of the services available at the US ATLAS shared Tier 3s is the Jupyter Lab enviroment. Some of the Jupyter kernels available there includes:

1. python2 with pyroot and uproot, some allows users to load an ATLAS analysis releases in order to access xAODs.
2. python3 with pyroot and uproot.
3. python3 with ML packages such as Tensoflow and Keras, with support of Nvidia GPUs.
4. Terminal console for simple interactive use, e.g. file managements.
